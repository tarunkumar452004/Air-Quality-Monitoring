# Real-Time Air Quality Prediction using Azure Machine Learning Studio

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using historical environmental data. The entire workflow is built using **Azure Machine Learning Studio** to leverage cloud-based scalability and ease of deployment. The final model is deployed as a **web service API** on Azure for real-time predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

With rising urban pollution levels, it has become crucial to monitor and predict air quality in real-time. Traditional manual monitoring systems are slow and ineffective. A predictive AI system can help individuals and governments take timely precautions.

## âœ… Objectives

- Predict AQI based on features like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, Temperature, etc.
- Use Azure Machine Learning Studio for model training and evaluation.
- Deploy the model as a REST API using Azure services.
- (Optional) Build a simple front-end using Streamlit or HTML to interact with the model.
